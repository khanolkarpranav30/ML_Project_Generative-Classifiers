Generative Classifiers

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using Generative Models and Naive Bayes Classifier.
Generative models aim to model the joint probability distribution of the data and labels, helping us generate new samples and classify data based on probabilities. Naive Bayes, a simple yet powerful probabilistic classifier, assumes feature independence and uses Bayes' theorem for prediction.

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming that features are conditionally independent given the class label.

Why Naive Bayes?

Simple and Fast: Efficient for large datasets
Robust to Irrelevant Features
Works Well with High-Dimensional Data, such as images
In this project, we use the Multinomial Naive Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes variants for classification.
